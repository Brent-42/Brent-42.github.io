    <p>Duna</p>
        <img src="Duna.png">
        <p>Duna is the fourth planet from Kerbol and the fourth-largest planet.
            It is the Mars analog for Kerbal Space Program.
            It has one tidally-locked and large natural satellite, the moon Ike.
            Duna is a terrestrial planet with a red-brown surface and polar ice caps similar to that of Kerbin.</p>

        <p>In- Game Description:</p>

        <p>Also known as the red dot that you can see if you squint at it really hard, Duna has long been a wonder to Kerbalkind.
            The planet has been held in much awe, due to its striking red color and stark contrast to the color green.</p>
